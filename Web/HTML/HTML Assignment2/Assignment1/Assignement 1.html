        <h1>Silicon Valley logs in to Digital India: IT giants shower praise & projects</h1>
        <p>Silicon Valley stars and start-ups signed on to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's expansive
			and passionate vision of a "Digital India" this weekend, announcing a slew of initiatives 
			baby steps expected to lead to more intimate ties between the world's famed tech eco-system 
			and a fertile market replete with both problems and solutions. Microsoft said it will partner 
			with New Delhi to bring low-cost broadband connectivity to 500,000 villages in India, 
			Google said it will help India set up base for free Wi-Fi at 500 railway stations, 
			and Qualcomm pledged to invest $150 million in Indian start-ups, as America's tech giants, 
			spanning Seattle to San Jose to San Diego on the Pacific Coast, responded with alacrity 
			to Modi's espousal of India's transformation on a scale that is, perhaps, unmatched in human history

        <h1>Silicon Valley goes formal on a Sunday for NaMo</h1>
        <p>
            Famed for its casual and laid-back looks and lifestyle, Silicon Valley went ceremonial, official, 
			and formal for Prime Minister Narendra Modi on a warm weekend from the moment he landed on Saturday 
			morning at the Norm Mineta Airport, named after a former US transportation secretary who himself 
			turned up to receive him. It was the first of many surprises in a city where summer never seems to end.
